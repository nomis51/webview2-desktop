# Webview2 Desktop with Angular (or any JS/TS frameworks)
A C# desktop application template using webview2 and angular.

Can be easily adapted to use any other JS frameworks such as Vue, React, Svelte, etc. The C# template is using WPF, but it could be replaced by WinForms easily.

## Requirements
- Node.js
- Angular CLI (to run the demo, but not necessary if Angular is replaced by another JS framework)

## Try it out
- Clone the repository
- Open the `Client` folder and run `ng serve` (for Angular, adjust for other frameworks)
- Open the C# project
- Run it with Visual Studio, Jetbrains Rider or dotnet CLI
- The window will show up with the demo, enjoy!
