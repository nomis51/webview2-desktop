# Webview2 Desktop with React/Angular/Vue (or any JS/TS frameworks)
A proof of concept for a C# desktop application template using webview2 and React.

Can be easily adapted to use any other JS frameworks such as Angular, Vue, React, Svelte, etc. The C# template is using WPF, but it could be replaced by WinForms easily.

## Requirements
- Node.js
- Vite (to run the demo, but not necessary if React is replaced by another JS framework)

## Try it out
- Clone the repository
- Open the `Client` folder and run `yarn dev` (for React, adjust for other frameworks)
- Open the C# project
- Run it with Visual Studio, Jetbrains Rider or dotnet CLI
- The window will show up with the demo, enjoy!
